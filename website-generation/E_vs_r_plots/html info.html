<h2>Cohesive Energy vs. Interatomic Spacing</h2>
<p>
    Plots of the cohesive energy vs interatomic spacing, <i>r</i>, are shown below 
    for a number of crystal structures.  The structures are generated based on the 
    ideal atomic positions and <i>b</i>/<i>a</i> and <i>c</i>/<i>a</i> lattice 
    parameter ratios for a given crystal prototype. The size of the system is then 
    uniformly scaled, and the energy calculated without relaxing the system. To 
    obtain these plots, 200 values of <i>r</i> are evaluated between 2.0 and 6.0 
    &Aring;.  Clicking on the plot will open a table containing the numerical values.

    <b>Disclaimer</b>: These results are meant to be used as guidelines for 
    comparing potentials, not as definitive measurements for the properties. The minima 
    identified by this calculation do not guarantee that the associated crystal 
    structures will be stable since no relaxation is performed. Variations in the values 
    may occur for fully relaxed configurations, different <i>b</i>/<i>a</i> and 
    <i>c</i>/<i>a</i> lattice parameter ratios, different simulation software and 
    different implementations of the interatomic potential.

    <b>Version Information:</b> As property calculation methods are developed and updated, there 
    may be changes in the calculated values. Updates to the calculation methods 
    that affect the values will be documented and archival versions of this page 
    will be made available as a record. 
    <ul><li>
        2017-01-11. Replaced png pictures with interactive Bokeh plots. Data regenerated
        with 200 values of r instead of 300.
    </li><li>
        2016-09-28. Plots for binary structures added. Data and plots for elemental 
        structures regenerated. Data values match the values of the previous version.
        Data table formatting slightly changed to increase precision and ensure spaces 
        between large values. Composition added to plot title and structure names made 
        longer.
