#Cohesive energy (eV) vs. nearest neighbor radial distance (A) for various crystal structures
#Data presented for interatomic potential <potential> and composition <composition>

#NOTE: These values are for static, unrelaxed structures and use the ideal b/a and c/a ratios for the crystal structure, not the potential-specific values
