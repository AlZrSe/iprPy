iprPy Documentation
===================

This section contains documentation for iprPy.  The complete documentation
comes in two formats:

`HTML <html/index.html>`_ is full HTML webpages of the documentation.  This is
preferred if you are viewing a local copy of iprPy.

`restructuredtext <rst/index.rst>`_ is restructuredtext files of the
documentation.  This is preferred if you are viewing from GitHub as it will
automatically be rendered.

Both of these formats should be identical and are generated using custom
Python scripts, and Sphinx conversion of source restructuredtext files.  All
source files and code can be found in the source directory, except for the
builddoc script that manages the conversions.
