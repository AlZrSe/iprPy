==================================
Run a Jupyter Calculation Notebook
==================================

Each calculation exists in two forms: a Python script and a Jupyter Notebook.  Both versions of the calculation contain the same underlying calculation methods and functions, but differ with input/output interfaces and how the information is presented.

The calculation Notebooks can be found in the iprPy/Notebook directory.  Static HTML copies can also be viewed here.

Notebook Overview
-----------------

Each Notebook provides a complete, self-contained documentation of the calculation.  The primary components of each Notebook consist of

1. Introduction and description of the calculation.

2. An in-depth discussion of the calculation's methods and theory.

3. Calculation input parameter setup.  This details the different inputs used by the calculation and how they are defined.

4. The working calculation functions, which are identical to the corresponding functions in the associated Python calculation scripts.

5. A simple display of the calculation's results.
