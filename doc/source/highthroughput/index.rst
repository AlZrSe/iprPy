High-Throughput Tools
=====================

Designing the calculations to be independent units of work that read standard
input files makes performing the calculations in high-throughput incredibly
simple.  All you have to do is execute the same calculation scripts with
different input files.  And with the calculation results being reported in
XML/JSON, the accumulated data can automatically be uploaded into a database.

With iprPy, performing calculations in high-throughput is a two-step process.

1. You :doc:`prepared <prepare>` a calculation.  This creates multiple
   instances of the calculation within a specified "run_directory".  Each
   instance is a folder containing a copy of the calculation's script, a
   unique input parameter file, and any other files required to perform the
   calculation.  Additionally, an incomplete record associated with each
   calculation instance is added to a database.
2. You start one or more :doc:`runners <runner>`.  Each runner operates on a
   single "run_directory" systematically performing one prepared calculation
   instance after another.  When each calculation finishes, successfully or
   unsuccessfully, the corresponding record in the database is updated and the
   calculation instanceâ€™s folder is archived and added to the database.
