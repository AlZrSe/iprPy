Introduction
============

The **stacking\_fault\_static** calculation evaluates the energy of a
single generalized stacking fault shift along a specified
crystallographic plane.

**Disclaimer #1**: The system's dimension perpendicular to the fault
plane should be large to minimize the interaction of the free surface
and the stacking fault.
