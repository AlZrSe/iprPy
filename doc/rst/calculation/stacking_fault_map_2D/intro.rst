Introduction
============

The **stacking\_fault\_map\_2D** calculation evaluates the full 2D
generalized stacking fault map for an array of shifts along a specified
crystallographic plane. A regular grid of points is established and the
generalized stacking fault energy is evaluated at each.

**Version notes**: This was previously called the stacking\_fault\_multi
calculation and was renamed for clarity.

**Disclaimer #1**: The system's dimension perpendicular to the fault
plane should be large to minimize the interaction of the free surface
and the stacking fault.
