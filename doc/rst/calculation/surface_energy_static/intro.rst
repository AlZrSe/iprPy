Introduction
============

The **surface\_energy** calculation evaluates the formation energy for a
free surface by slicing an atomic system along a specific plane.

**Disclaimer #1**: Other atomic configurations at the free surface for
certain planar cuts may have lower energies. The atomic relaxation will
find a local minimum, which may not be the global minimum. Additionally,
the material cut is planar perfect and therefore does not explore the
effects of atomic roughness.
