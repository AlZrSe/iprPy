Reference Library
*****************

A number of reference records can be found in the iprPy/library
directory.  These collect together metadata and data associated with
meaningful parameter sets that can then be used as inputs for the
calculations.  The design of the record schemas is meant to be as
clear as possible for people to interpret visually without relying on
the iprPy code base.  See the description of a given record style to
learn more about its format.

New reference records can simply be added to the iprPy/library
directory, then uploaded to a database with the Database.build_ref()
method or the build_ref option of the iprPy command line tool.
