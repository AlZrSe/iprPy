<h2>Static Crystal Structure Predictions</h2>
<p>
    The properties listed here are obtained from static calculations for given 
    crystal structures. The values were obtained using an algorithm that takes 
    an initial estimate for the lattice constants and evaluates the cohesive 
    energy and virial pressures for the structure. Elastic constants are calculated 
    using the changes in the virial pressures due to the application of small strains 
    (1e-5). The pressure values and elastic compliances are used to obtain a new lattice 
    parameter guess by linearly extrapolating to zero pressure. This process is repeated 
    until the lattice constants from one iteration to the next are within a relative 
    tolerance of 1e-10. The elastic constants shown coincide with the final iteration.
</p><p>
    Initial estimates for the lattice constants correspond to all the energy minima 
    identified in the cohesive energy vs interatomic spacing plots. This means that 
    it is possible that some potentials have multiple refined results for the same 
    crystal structure. Having multiple energy minimums for a structure does not 
    necessarily make the potential 'bad' as unwanted configurations may be unstable or 
    correspond to conditions that may not be relevant to the problem of interest 
    (eg. very high strains).

    <b>Disclaimer:</b> These values are meant to be guidelines for comparing 
    potentials, not the absolute values for any potential's properties. The 
    presence of any structures in this list does not guarantee that those 
    structures are stable as only the box dimensions are changed, not the 
    relative positions of the atoms in the cell. Also, the lowest energy 
    structure may not be included in this list. Variations in the values may 
    occur for fully relaxed configurations, different small strain values, 
    different simulation software and different implementations of the 
    interatomic potential. The algorithm used works best when the interatomic 
    potential's elastic constants vary smoothly with changes in volume.

    <b>Version Information:</b> As property calculation methods are developed and updated, there 
    may be changes in the calculated values. Updates to the calculation methods 
    that affect the values will be documented and archival versions of this page 
    will be made available as a record.

        2016-09-28. Values for simple compounds added. All identified energy minima 
        for each structure are listed. The existing elemental data was regenerated. Most values are 
        consistent with before, but some differences have been noted. Specifically, variations are 
        seen with some values for potentials where the elastic constants don't vary smoothly near 
        the equilibrium state. Additionally, the inclusion of some high-energy structures has 
        changed based on new criteria for identifying when structures have relaxed to another structure.
