<h2>Static Crystal Structure Predictions</h2>
<p>
    Computed lattice and elastic constants for statically relaxed crystal structures are presented below.  The values were computed using two iprPy calculation methods: refine_structure and LAMMPS_ELASTIC.  Both calculations relax a 3x3x3 supercell of the crystal's unit cell, and evaluate the system's elastic constants by applying small strains (10<sup>-8</sup>).  Values are only shown for calculations that successfully ran, and resulted in final configurations that are identified as not relaxing to a different crystal family.

    The refine_structure calculation evaluates a system's cohesive energy, virial pressures and elastic constants without any atomic relaxations.  The dimensions of the system are rescaled to a zero pressure estimate obtained using a linear extrapolation from the measured pressures and elastic compliances.  This process is repeated until the lattice constants from one iteration to the next are within a relative tolerance of 10<sup>-10</sup>.

    The LAMMPS_ELASTIC calculation performs an energy minimization that simultaneously adjusts both atomic coordinates and system dimensions.  Upon completion, the system's cohesive energy, lattice constants and elastic constants are evaluated.  This process is repeated until the lattice constants from one iteration to the next are within a relative tolerance of 10<sup>-10</sup>.  Iteration is important as the underlying algorithm can have trouble fully relaxing the system dimensions in one run if the initial values are far from the equilibrium values.

    Disagreements between the two calculation methods are possible due to their different relaxation algorithms.  The refine_structure calculation only relaxes the box and not the atoms, thus uses an idealized representation of the crystal structures.  As the LAMMPS_ELASTIC calculation does do static relaxation of the atomic positions, it is more likely to reveal a structure as relaxing to a different structure and can provide better elastic constants for more complicated crystals.  With either calculation, the predicted structures are not guaranteed to be stable and may further relax with dynamic integration or if symmetries in the lattice constants are broken.

    <b>Note</b>: Multiple values for the same crystal structure and calculation method are possible.  This is because all configurations corresponding to local energy minima identified in the Cohesive Energy vs Interatomic Spacing plots are used as initial guesses for the crystal structure prediction calculations.  Having multiple energy minimums for a structure does not necessarily make the potential 'bad' as unwanted configurations may be unstable or correspond to conditions that may not be relevant to the problem of interest (eg. very high strains).

    <b>Disclaimer:</b> These values are meant to be guidelines for comparing potentials, not the absolute values for any potential's properties. The presence of any structures in this list does not guarantee that those structures are stable.  Also, the lowest energy structure may not be included in this list.  Variations in the values may occur for variations in relaxation methods, small strain values, simulation software and implementations of the interatomic potentials.
</p><p>
    <b>Version Information:</b> As property calculation methods are developed and updated, there may be changes in the calculated values. Updates to the calculation methods that affect the values will be documented and archival versions of this page will be made available as a record.

        2017-09-28.  Values regenerated with the refine_structure method using a small strain value of 10<sup>-8</sup> instead of 10<sup>-5</sup>.  Values using LAMMPS_ELASTIC method added.  Calculations involving MEAM potentials corrected.  The value tables have been redesigned and the description of the calculations updated.
    </li><li>
        2016-09-28.  Values for simple compounds added.  All identified energy minima for each structure are listed.  The existing elemental data was regenerated.  Most values are consistent with before, but some differences have been noted. Specifically, variations are seen with some values for potentials where the elastic constants don't vary smoothly near the equilibrium state.  Additionally, the inclusion of some high-energy structures has changed based on new criteria for identifying when structures have relaxed to another structure.
