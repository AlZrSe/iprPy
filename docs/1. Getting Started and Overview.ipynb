Doing so will not only give you basic Python, but a number of highly useful packages, such as the scipy family, as well as some development tools, such as Jupyter Notebooks. The scipy family (scipy, numpy, pandas) are highly integrated into the iprPy frameword do to their usefulness. "

    "\n",

    "- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) Tools for plotting data.\n",
