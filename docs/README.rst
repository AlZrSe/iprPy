iprPy Calculation Demonstrations
================================

This directory contains documentation and demonstrations for the implemented 
calculations in the form of Jupyter Notebooks. The documentation is divided 
into two categories 

    - The reference subdirectory contains Notebooks that outline the parameter 
      terms used by the complete calculation scripts, and the associated high-
      throughput prepare functions. They also provide a demonstration of 
      running the calculation.

    - The methods subdirectory contains Notebooks that reveal the underlying 
      calculation methodology used. The Python functions used to set up, run, 
      and analyze simulations is replicated, and any necessary inputs for a 
      simple demonstration are given or embedded providing a stand-alone 
      representation of the calculation.
