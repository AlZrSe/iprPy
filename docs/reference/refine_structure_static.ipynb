    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The __refine_structure_static__ calculation refines the lattice parameters of an orthogonal system (crystal structure) by calculating the elastic constant using small displacements, and then using the elastic stiffnesses to iterate towards zero pressure. In refining the lattice parameter values, the box dimensions are allowed to relax, but the relative positions of the atoms within the box are held fixed. \n",
    "\n",
    "This calculations provides a quick tool for obtaining both the lattice and elastic constants for a given structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Disclaimer__: With this method there is no guarantee that the resulting parameters are for a stable structure. Allowing internal relaxations may result in different values for some structures. Additionally, some transformation paths may be restricted from ocurring, which allows for unstable structures to be refined."
