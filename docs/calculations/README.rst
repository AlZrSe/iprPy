iprPy Calculation Demonstrations
================================

This directory contains documentation and demonstrations for the implemented 
calculations in the form of Jupyter Notebooks. The documentation is divided 
into the following subdirectories

1. methodology: The Notebooks in this subdirectory are complete records of a
   calculation, containing working embedded code and full descriptions of the
   calculation methodology. Look here if you want to run a single calculation
   from a Notebook environment, or you want to learn how a calculation is
   performed.
      
2. preparing: The Notebooks in this subdirectory outline the parameter terms
   used by the high-throughput prepare scripts associated with the different
   calculation scripts. Look here if you want to run a calculation over a
   wide range of parameter conditions and have the resulting data
   automatically added to a database.
   
3. running: The Notebooks in this subdirectory outline the parameter terms
   used by the calculations themselves. Look here if you want to run a single
   calculation by itself using the standalone calculation script and input
   file.
