    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The __point_defect_formation_static__ calculation evaluates the formation energy for a variety of point defects and evaluates whether the defect configurations remain stable after relaxation. A perfect system is constructed and the cohesive energy is calculated. Then, a point defect is inserted into the system and the defect's formation energy is computed. The configuration of the defect and neighboring atoms of the relaxed system are used to check if the defect strucutre has relaxed to a lower energy configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Disclaimer__: this method uses pre-defined point defect configurations and relaxes the systems through energy/force minimization. The lowest energy defect configuration may not be one of the pre-defined ones and may require a more thorough (temperature) annealing to obtain. The algorithms used to identify when a defect structure relaxes to another configuration have been tested for simple materials/defects and may not work for all cases."
