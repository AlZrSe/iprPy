iprPy High-Throughput Computational Framework
=============================================

The iprPy framework is a collection of tools and resources supporting the
design of scientific calculations that

- have transparent methodologies,
- are self-contained,
- are openly available,
- and can be integrated into workflows.
  
To accomplish these objectives, the framework consists of many smaller
components that work together:

1. Implemented calculation scripts.
2. Library of reference records.
3. Database access methods.
4. High-throughput scripts.
5. Methods for common handling of calculation inputs.
  
The framework was originally created to support the NIST Interatomic Potential
Repository by evaluating basic materials properties across multiple classical
interatomic potentials.  Because of this, many of the included calculations
and tools are designed towards molecular dynamics simulations.
