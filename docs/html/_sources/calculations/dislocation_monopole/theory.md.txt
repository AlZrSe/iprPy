## Method and Theory

The calculation follows the convention that the system is oriented with the dislocation line parallel to the Cartesian z-axis and positioned at x,y coordinates (0, 0), and the slip plane normal to the y-axis. The system is periodic along the box's c vector, and non-periodic in the other two box vector directions. The non-periodic bounds are handled by defining a boundary region of atoms held fixed at the elasticity
