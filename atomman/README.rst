Atomic Manipulation Toolkit 

This package is designed to allow easy manipulation of atomistic systems and 
rapid development of new property calculation metrics. 

The core module defines classes Atom, Box and System for representing an atomic
system and class DataModel for interacting with json/XML based data models.

The lammps module has methods and classes to assist in the creation of LAMMPS 
input scripts and the exchange of information between LAMMPS and AtomMan

The tools module contains numerous methods associated with system manipulations
(i.e. defect insertion) and property calculation metrics.

Demonstration Jupyter Notebooks are available...
